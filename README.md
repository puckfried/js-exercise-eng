# JS Exercise


### Preparation

- Create an index.html, style.css, and script.js file
- Set up a basic HTML structure
- Link the style and script files in the HTML
- In the HTML file, there should be a box with 3 buttons arranged vertically and centered within the box
- Below this, there should be another box with an input field and a button (use only an input, not a form element)

### Task
- Each button should have functionality:
- `Color` --> the box should be colored with a different background 
- `Rotate` --> the box should rotate 360 degrees, use `transition` to see the effect
- `Hide` --> on clicking, the entire box should disappear

- The last button was not covered in the presentation, try googling them or ask me :-)
    - `Print` --> the text from the input field should be displayed below. (Tipp: You can access the value of the input field using the property .value, e.g., `myInput.value` )

### Bonus
Challenge: CHange the function of the color button so, that with every click, a random color is selected - this can't be done using CSS class, you have to use element.style.backgroundColor, to change the color and you have to create a random color value every time the function is called. Try to research. This is quiete tricky!
